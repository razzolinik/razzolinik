## 🌸 About Me
I’m a Computer Science student from Argentina, currently exploring the endless world of **web development**.  
Coding for me isn’t just about building stuff — it’s about making ideas real, having fun, and maybe breaking a few things along the way (then fixing them 😅).  

💻 Main interests: **Frontend magic + Backend logic**  
🎯 Current focus: React · Node.js · TypeScript · MongoDB · Java  
🎧 Coding fuel: pop perfection + coke zero

## 🛠️ Tech Toolbox
**Frontend:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript · React · Vite · Bootstrap  
**Backend:** Node.js · Java · C · JakartaEE · GlassFish  
**Databases:** MySQL · MongoDB

## 📈 What I’m Up To
- Building projects to level up my fullstack skills  
- Experimenting with new frameworks and tools  
- Looking to collaborate on fun, creative ideas  
- Trying not to break prod (…yet)
